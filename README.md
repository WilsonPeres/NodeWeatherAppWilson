## Node weather app
This was a project I made in the Road to Hire program where we leaned how to fetch data from an api using the nodejs runtime environment. We also use ejs to display and show the fetched data received from the api. 

## Cloning the website
Download or clone this repoistory onto your computer. Once that is complete, you will need to install the node packages that were used to build this application. You can download the packages by running `npm i` in your terminal. 

## Running the app
After you have installed the packages you need, you can now run this project on your command line. Once you are in the root directory of the project, you can then run `node index` in your command line. The terminal will then prompt you to open the local host that the project runs on. 

## Stopping the app
To stop the server from running, hit `command + c`.
